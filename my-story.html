          <hr class="style-two">
          <div class="container">
            <p>When I was 13 my dad was brutally murdered by the Idi Amin regime. My
              Dad died at the age of 44, just as I began to truly know him and
              admire him as my true hero. I loved my father so much. I was so
              devastated and shocked…..words cannot describe. It was the most heart
              wrenching experience.</p>

            <p>Not only were we robbed of a father and breadwinner. But everything
              material that we owned was taken overnight. Everything was gone in a flash, taken.</p>

            <p>Riches to rags doesn’t begin to describe what we went through. It was
              moments like those that I felt God had indeed forsaken us. Father
              Grimes of Namasagali college took me and my siblings in and catered for our school fees
              for the next few years.</p>

            <p>The turning point in my life was about a year later, on the day when
              the family sat down on a mat, not a dining table, to have tea without
              Sugar for the first time. My mother insisted we just get used to it
              and drink the tea. Then my youngest brother started crying for Daddy.
              Then my mother who had 6 children by the age of 30 started crying too.
              Hysterically. And asking God to come and take us all. Then I felt a
              big lump in my throat.</p>

            <p>That night I was on the Akamba Bus to Nairobi to look for some sugar.
              I returned the next day with a suitcase full of sugar – 15 kgs. I got
              some extra from concerned relatives that realized a 14-year-old had
              come all the way to Kenya just for sugar. Traveling that far in those
              days was unheard of, it was like going to Syria today. Communication
              was hardly there. Crossing the border was scary but no one suspected a
              young kid to be smuggling sugar in a school suitcase. When I got back
              home there was so much delight and happiness. My mum hugged me. I
              automatically realized that I was no longer a boy. I had become a man.
              That one act had re-defined me. The neighbors heard through the grapevine
              that I had brought sugar and almost begged to buy some. So we sold
              them half, and got 4 times what it had cost. And I was on the bus back
              to Kenya for another suitcase of sugar…and so my career began.</p>

            <p>Do you know what it is to live without a Door lock on the front of
              your house, or not to have a bathroom door that actually closed? That is the loss of Dignity. I had to
              restore our dignity and family Self
              Esteem.</p>
